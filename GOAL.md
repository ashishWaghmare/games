# Expert System for Games

Using Tic tac Toe to develop Expert System and latter evolve to use it for building Chess or Optimization programme

expert system = knowledge + inference



## Overall Objectives

### Unit-III
Introduction to Expert Systems: 
  Definition why build an expert system, 
  application areas of expert system 
  how are expert systems used. 
Characteristics of Expert Systems, 
  Structure of expert system, 
  characteristics and phases and people involved in building an expert systems,

Inference Techniques, 
Types of reasoning deductive, inductive, abductive, analogical, common-sence and non-monotonic,
